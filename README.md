# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This project performs sentiment analysis on tweets to determine whether the sentiment expressed in a tweet is positive, negative, or neutral. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques for data cleaning and traditional as well as deep learning models for classification, including BERT-based sentiment classification.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing of tweets
- Tokenization and stemming/lemmatization
- Feature extraction using CountVectorizer / TF-IDF
- Traditional machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM)
- Fine-tuned BERT model for contextual sentiment classification
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
- Confusion matrix and visualization of sentiment distribution
